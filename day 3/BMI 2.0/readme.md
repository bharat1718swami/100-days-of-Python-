# Instructions
 Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

<br>

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.



* Under 18.5 they are underweight

* Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight

* Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight

* Over 30 but below 35 they are obese

* Above 35 they are clinically obese.

<br>

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning** you should **round** the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. **underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

**Example Input

weight = 85
height = 1.75


**Example Output

85 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.

<br>
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

"Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."

"Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."

"Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."

"Your BMI is 33, you are obese."

"Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."


**Hint**

1. Try to use the **exponent** operator in your code.
2. Remember to **round** your result to the nearest whole number.
3. Make sure you include the words in **bold** from the interpretations.
